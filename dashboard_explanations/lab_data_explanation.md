# Lab Data Dashboard

## What it shows
This Power BI dashboard analyzes lab performance using operational data from an Excel file. It focuses on turnaround times (TAT), delays by client and method, staff workload, and sample volume trends.

## Key visuals
- Average TAT by test method
- Delays by client and instrument
- Weekly trend of sample intake
- Workload breakdown by reporting staff
- On-time vs. delayed job classification

## Why it matters
This dashboard helps identify process delays, high-workload areas, and reporting performance issues. It gives lab managers a clear view of how efficiently samples move through the workflow, and where improvements can be made.

## Tools used
- **Power BI** for building visuals and dashboards
- **DAX** for calculating metrics like turnaround time, delays, and classification
- **Excel** as the data source
